# Prosopon: Face recognition training software

This is a very primitive / simple application that lets you train to recognize faces and keep track of your performances.

Scientific papers show that training via a "find the impostor" (or "discrimination") is more efficient than just trying to learn a lot of faces, so this software takes this approach.

Feel free to make new branches with better features :) 

The faces used are from public databases.
